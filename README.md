# NYC_School_Test_Scores
This project analyzes SAT scores of various schools across different boroughs in New York City. The main objectives are to identify the top-performing schools based on their combined SAT scores and to determine which borough has the highest variability in SAT scores. The analysis is performed using Python and the pandas library.
